### Out of interest, i took this course outside of my curriculum.


COMP322 Introduction to C++ was a 1 credit course but it felt like a 3 credit one.


Overview of the course: Basics and advanced features of the C++ language. Syntax, memory management, class structure, method and operator overloading, multiple inheritance, access control, stream I/O, templates, exception handling.

Although it was tough for me because at the moment i was having some hard time running c++ on my windows10 laptop and also strugling with some 3rd year comp sci hard courses, overall the experience was interesting and challenging.
