out of interest, i took this course outside of my curriculum.
COMP322 Introduction to C++ was a 1 credit course but it felt like a 3 credit one.
Overview of the course: Basics and advanced features of the C++ language. Syntax, memory management, class structure, method and operator overloading, multiple inheritance, access control, stream I/O, templates, exception handling.

it was tough for me because i was having so much hard time to run c++ on my windows10 and also at that time i was taking some hard courses, overall the experience was fun and interesting.
